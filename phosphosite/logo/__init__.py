# TODO: 
# use statistical information to determine structural motif logo
# will have to define a 'structural motif' as the set of all bubbles 
# for a given kinase (known through matching PSP dataset)
# then, for each bubble, determine the probability of a given amino acid
# being in that bubble, which scales each residue (i.e. the '3rd nearest residue') 
# scale with information content.
