### PhosphoSitePlus data



Here, we extract information by web scraping from PSP.  The data we are looking for is the number of HTP/LTP references for each
phosphorylation site.  This is not contained in the `downloads` section with the list of phosphorylation sites.

Credit: James Rosse from Systems Biology Initiative for developing the web scraping code.
